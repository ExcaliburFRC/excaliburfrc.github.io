            <span class="span5">The FRC is a competition in which teams, consisting of high school students from around the world. Every year, the teams are presented with a unique challenge. The teams must then build a robot that can effectively perform all the necessary parts of the challenge. Every team is given 6 weeks for building the robot and preparing it for the competitions. During that time period, the teams build many prototypes, design in “SolidWorks”, create part while using Complex machinery, such as CNC machines and 3D printers, build the mechanical elements of the robot, implement electronics, motors, and pneumatics into the system, and of course - program it. Meanwhile, the teams make posts and their robots on social media, and document the work that they do. </span>
