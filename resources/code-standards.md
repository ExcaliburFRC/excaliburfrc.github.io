### Code Standards
We use the [Google Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) for all Java code.
For Gradle projects (including robot code) this can be enforced using [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless).
To setup Spotless in a project, see the [Spotless docs](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless).
