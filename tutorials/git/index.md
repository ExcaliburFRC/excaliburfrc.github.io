# Git & GitHub
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the version control system (VCS) that we use for team code, and we host our git repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com).

Some git terminology:
- **`repository`** (**`repo`**) - the project folder.
- **`commit`** - a group of changes that do something / a point in the history of the repo.
- **`branch`** - a commit history of the repo.
- **`clone`** - create a local copy of the repository.
- **`push`** - update the remote repository with your local changes.
- **`pull`** - update your local repository with the remote changes.
- **`pull request`** (**`PR`**) - a request to merge the changes in a branch to the main branch.

[frc-docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/git-getting-started.html)
has a good explanation of Git basics and a tutorial for creating your first repository.

This tutorial is for creating Pull Requests based on our Git workflow.
