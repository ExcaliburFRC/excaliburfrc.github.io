[FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition)](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) is an international
high-school robotics competition in which two alliances of three teams each compete to score as many points
as possible on the year-specific field in a match (2 minutes, 15 seconds).
Teams have a build season of 6 weeks to build their robot and prepare it for the competitions. During that
time, teams prototype their robot, design it in 3D CAD software, create parts using complex machinery (CNC
routers, 3D printers, etc), build the mechanical elements of the robot, set up electronics, motors, sensors,
and pneumatics into the robot, and program it.
One of FIRST's mottos is "More than robots", and in FRC this means that teams are also judged based on
contribution and activity in their community, including promoting STEM values.
Teams are also responsible for raising the funds for registration, the robot itself, travel to the
competitions, etc. This results in many teams being active on social media platforms.
