We are FRC team #6738 Excalibur, established in 2017. We now have ~40 high school students.
<br /><br />
In our first year, we won the Rookie All-Star and Rookie Inspiration awards, given to teams that show
potential and inspire.
<br />
In 2019, we reached remarkable achievements in all our regional competitions;
and in the national championship we led an alliance (of three teams) that advanced to the
finals and finished the season at second place in Israel.
<br /><br />
Throughout the year, we contributed as a team to the community through a variety of activities,
including robotics workshops and activities with different kindergartens and organizations.
Through these activities we are spreading the values ​​of STEM in the community.
We support and operate five <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll">FLL</a> teams
(FIRST Lego League, a FIRST robotics program for ages 4-16), and guide them in the challenges that they
face.
<br /><br />
In the coming season, we plan to significantly increase our community work and spread STEM
values, especially within populations with lower exposure to science and technology.
