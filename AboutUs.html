                Our group, 6738 #Excalibur is an FRC Group which was established in 2017. The group now has about 35 high school students. In our first year, we won the Rookie All-Star and Rookie Inspiration awards, given to a group which shows potential and inspires.
                <br/><br/> In the year 2019, we reached remarkable achievements in all The regional competitions, and in the national competition, we led an alliance (consisting of three different groups) that advanced to the finals and finished the season at second place in Israel. Throughout the year, we as a group contributed to the community through a variety of activities, including workshops, robotics, volunteer activities with different kindergartens and organizations, and through these activities, we are spreading the values ​​of science and technology among the youth. We support and operate five more FLL groups (robotics competitions for grades 5 through 8, another FIRST program) and guide them in the challenges that they face.
                <br/><br/>In the coming season, we plan to significantly increase the community issue and spread FIRSTs values, especially within populations with lower exposure to science and technology.
