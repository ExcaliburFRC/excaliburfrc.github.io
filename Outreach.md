### Community Outreach
One of the most important parts of FIRST is community outreach, that is relevant all year round (not
only during the build/competition season). One of FIRST's goals is to "raise the next generation of engineers" -
to bring children closer to science and technology. However, without community outreach, 
only those who actively participate in FIRST teams are affected.
<br/> <br/>
One of FIRST's mottos that many teams implement is "more than robots" - meaning that FIRST is not
just about the season itself, but also about spreading FIRSTs values to the people around. We believe
that this is our job. We pass these values on to children in elementary schools through activities about
science and technology and try to get as many people interested about STEM as possible.
<br/> <br/>
Furthermore, we as a team mentor 5 FLL teams (a similar robotics program for ages 4-16): we teach them, help
them understand robotics better, and generally teach them about FIRST and STEM.
<br/>
Additionally, we host an annual seminar series where we guide FLL mentors to effectively mentor FLL teams. 
There is usually much demand for the seminar and most who undergo it go on to successfully mentor FLL teams.
